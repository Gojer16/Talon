**Phase 3:** ⚠️ 10% Complete (missing most ecosystem features)  
**Phase 4:** ❌ 0% Complete (all polish features missing)

**Overall Progress:** ~70% of core functionality, ~30% of full vision
| **Shell Tool** | `shell_execute` with confirmation for destructive commands | P0 |

### Implementation Order

```
Week 1:  Config system → Gateway server → Event bus
Week 2:  Agent loop (state machine) → Model router → Memory manager
Week 3:  Tool registry → File tools → Shell tool
Week 4:  CLI REPL → Telegram channel → Session manager
Week 5:  Memory compression tuning → SOUL.md → Testing
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] `talon` command starts the Gateway and CLI
- [ ] Send a message on Telegram → get AI response
- [ ] AI can read/write files on your system
- [ ] AI can run shell commands (with confirmation for destructive ones)
- [ ] Agent loop iterates until task is complete (not one-shot)
- [ ] Memory summary stays ≤800 tokens regardless of conversation length
- [ ] Model router picks cheap model for simple tasks, premium for complex
- [ ] Conversation history persists (compressed) across restarts
- [ ] SOUL.md personality is reflected in responses

| **Logging** | Structured logging with levels (debug/info/warn/error) |
| **Documentation** | Keep docs in sync with implementation |
| **Performance** | Profile token usage, optimize context building |
| **Upgrades** | Track dependency updates, especially LLM SDK versions |

---

## Decision Log

Key architectural decisions and their rationale:

| Decision | Choice | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Node.js | Python, Go, Rust | Same as OpenClaw; excellent async I/O, huge npm ecosystem |
| **Language** | TypeScript | JavaScript | Type safety critical for tool interfaces and config validation |
| **Architecture** | Agent Loop (state machine) | Simple request→response | OpenClaw's real power is plan→execute→evaluate→refine |
| **Model strategy** | Router (cheapest per task) | Single premium model | Cost control: sub-agents on cheap models, reasoning on premium |
| **Memory** | Aggressive compression (≤800 tk summary) | Full history | Full history = millions of tokens/day = bankruptcy |
| **Sub-agents** | Specialist delegation | Single model does everything | Focused context = better quality + cheaper |
| **Primary LLM** | Mid-tier for orchestration | Always premium | Premium only for complex reasoning; mid-tier for decision-making |
| **Browser Engine** | Playwright | Puppeteer, CDP direct | Multi-browser support, better API, more reliable |
| **Chat Framework** | grammŸ (Telegram) | node-telegram-bot-api | TypeScript-first, better middleware, active maintenance |
| **Storage (MVP)** | JSON files | SQLite, PostgreSQL | Zero-dependency, human-readable, easy debugging |
| **Config Validation** | Zod | JSON Schema, joi | TypeScript integration, great DX, runtime + compile-time |
| **Monolith vs Mono-repo** | Monolith | Turborepo, Nx | Simpler for solo dev, lower overhead, faster iteration |
