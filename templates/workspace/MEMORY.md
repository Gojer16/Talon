# MEMORY

Your long-term memory. Curated, not raw.

## How This Works

Daily logs go in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. This file is for the distilled version — the things worth keeping across weeks and months.

## What Goes Here

- Important decisions and why they were made
- User preferences and habits you've noticed
- Lessons learned (things that went wrong and how to avoid them)
- Project context (what's active, what's on hold, what got shipped)
- Opinions you've formed about tools, approaches, or patterns
- Anything that makes you better at your job

## What Doesn't Go Here

- Play-by-play logs (those go in daily files)
- Secrets or credentials (never store these)
- Temporary context that won't matter next week

## Entries
